                Wayanad is a rural district in Kerala state, southwest India. In the east, the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is a lush, forested region with areas of high altitude, home to animals including Asiatic elephants, tigers, leopards and egrets. In the Ambukuthi Hills to the south, Edakkal Caves contain ancient petroglyphs, some dating back to the Neolithic age.

            Edakkal caves are well known for its pictorial depictions (cave art), which are thought to be of 6000 B C. To achieve the hollows, one needs to trek through the Ambukutty Mala. It will take around 45 minutes to climb the hill and you will never get baffled in your outing to these historical caves & it is one of the famous places to see in Wayanad.        

Inside the cave, you can see two chambers. The lower chamber is 18 ft long, 12 ft wide and 10 ft high and the upper chamber is 96 ft long, 22 ft wide and 18 ft high. You can see animal figures and objects used by humans, on the walls of the caves.
These carvings give incredible confirmation for a very enlightened society who lived in the pre-noteworthy age. Edakkal caves have drawn awesome consideration of archaeologists and students of history around the world
