                Thrissur is a city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It's known for sacred sites and colorful festivals. In the center is Vadakkumnathan Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva and adorned with murals. The ornate, Indo-Gothic Our Lady of Dolours Basilica is nearby. To the north, Thiruvambady Temple is home to several elephants. Sakthan Thampuran Palace houses an archaeology museum with bronze statues and ancient coins.

            Athirapally waterfalls <br>
            On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest in the state of Kerala.

            The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River, that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India
